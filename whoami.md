subtitle: Who is the maik, and what does he do?

I've made a career out of fixing broken computery things.  Mostly IT, some customer support, and a mix of security for good measure.

- I'm a father.
- I'm a hacker.
- I'm a gamer.
- I'm lawful good.

Not sure what else there is to say.  I'm most easily reachable via Twitter (@maik) or [NetSec Focus' MatterMost server](https://chat.netsecfocus.com/).
